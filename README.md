# 🏢 Facility Management Assessment & Improvement Project

This project presents a comprehensive facility assessment and improvement plan for a **multi-floor smart office building** located in a densely populated urban area. The project focused on evaluating the readiness and performance of core systems including **IT networking, HVAC, layout utilization, safety, and risk management**, with the aim of supporting smart building integration and operational readiness.

## 📌 Project Objective

- Assess current facility conditions and system functionality
- Identify layout, network, and safety issues that delay final commissioning
- Propose structured improvements to ensure full integration of smart systems
- Develop a **project management plan** with time-based milestones

---

## 🏢 Facility Context

- **Location:** Central city area with high public transport accessibility
- **Type:** Multi-floor office facility with rooftop and basement zones
- **Objective:** Smart building with integrated infrastructure for IT, HVAC, and safety

---

## 📐 Layout & Space Utilization Insights

- IT room relocation caused weak networking on upper floors
- Floors 5 and 6 have partial smart system integration with cabling malfunctions
- Rooftop and basement remain unused due to lack of system connectivity

### 🛠️ Recommendations:
- Improve access floor IT networks, particularly Floors 5 and 6
- Utilize unused rooftop/basement spaces by integrating necessary systems

---

## 🌬️ HVAC and Maintenance Assessment

- HVAC systems incomplete in several areas including rooftop and ground floor
- Ground floor HVAC loop is malfunctioning
- No preventive maintenance plan currently in place

### 🛠️ Recommendations:
- Finalize HVAC system installation and configuration
- Implement centralized **Building Management System (BMS)** for maintenance
- Conduct regular system testing for HVAC and electrical assets

---

## 🔐 Safety & Risk Management

- Incomplete access control (fingerprint, card readers)
- Unverified CCTV deployment and unclear emergency systems
- Need for ventilation/fire system integration with smart controls

### 🛠️ Recommendations:
- Expedite access control and CCTV system installations
- Validate safety compliance with specialized engineers
- Resolve electrical load and breaker configurations before final audit

---

## 🧠 Project Management Plan

- Network reassessment on floors 5 & 6
- Complete HVAC installation on rooftop and ground floor
- Finish safety integration: Access, CCTV, and fire compliance
- Phased timeline:

| Phase | Timeline | Tasks |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Short-term | 1 week | CCTV setup, cable termination |
| Mid-term | 2–3 weeks | HVAC completion, access control |
| Long-term | 1 month | Network integration and final safety audit |

---

## 📊 Project Outcome

- Created a structured improvement roadmap to prepare the building for commissioning
- Aligned multiple engineering disciplines toward a common smart-building goal
- Demonstrated the role of **facility management in safety, efficiency, and sustainability**
